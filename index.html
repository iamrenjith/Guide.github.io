          I am a doctoral researcher at Loughborough University, United Kingdom. My research focus on helping people design and construct comfortable
          homes that consume less energy. <!--As part of my research, I have developed a building design guide. This guide would help designers
          and architects in the early design stages for construction of buildings that would exhibit high thermal and daylight performance.

    <p><li><i><b>Climate-based building design:</b></i></li> Indoor comfort is greatly influenced by the outdoor weather conditions, and the
    responsiveness of buildings to the prevailing local climate plays an important role if the dual aspects of occupant comfort
    and low energy demand are to be met. My primary research interest is to aid the design and construction of buildings that would
    exhibit hight thermal and daylight performance and are tailored for the respective climate zones. With this view, I have developed a building
    performance simulation based design guide for construction of buildings in the different climate zones of Kerala (India). This guide would help
    designers and architects during the early design stages for construction of buildings that would exhibit high thermal and daylight performance.

    I am interested in understanding and improving the indoor comfort conditions in buildings. In align with this intrest I had worked on understanding
    how the building design influences occupant thermal and visual comfort in different climatic condition. More information can be found

        <p> My paper on the “Influence of climate on performance of buildings in Kerala” had inferred that the State of Kerala has regions
         with different climatic characteristics and that the designs for buildings should be tailored for the climate zones of Kerala.
         These results are in contrast to the observation of the National Building Code of India and the American Society of Heating,
         Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.

         In 2018, Kerala witnessed the worst flood after 1924. In response, the Government

The guide, presented via a web-based platform aims to as- sist practitioners and policymakers during the early building design stage to achieve higher thermal and daylight performance. This study focused on (a) assessing the usability of the contents of the guide in assisting users during the early design-stages and (b) identifying design/navigation issues, for the web- platform, that would affect the user experience. The results of the usability testing showed that the par- ticipants generally perceived the design guide easy to use and valuable during early design stages. The par- ticipants found the concept of providing the guide via an interactive web-based platform useful, as it would be easily accessible to a wide range of audience. Fur- thermore, the participants provided suggestions on areas for possible future improvements.</p>

              Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) mission” – plans to build more than 750,000 houses across the State, using a uniform design, irrespective
              of the location or climate. A previous study has identified regions with different climatic characteristics within Kerala using a method based on
              adaptive thermal comfort model. This study aims to understand how the building design influences occupant comfort in the different adaptive climate
              zones by performing an uncertainty analysis on the output metrics. The thermal comfort was assessed based on the hours requiring heating/cooling while
              visual comfort was assessed based on the Useful Daylight Illuminance metric. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to identify design parameters
              that influence occupant comfort. The results of this study will serve as a reference for practitioners during the early stages of design to achieve
              thermal and visual comfort for high performance residential buildings.</p>

              and architects in achieving energy efficiency in buildings using building perfor- mance simulation. Previous studies highlighted the need for climate
              assessments at higher resolutions for the purpose of climate classification but failed to in- fer the resolution requirement. In this study, climate
              zones of Kerala (one of the 29 States in India) are defined and delineated with climate data from grid resolutions of 10, 15, 20 and 25 km. The
              delineated zones are then assessed by comparing them with the thermal performance of a building representative of building typology of Kerala to
              identify the grid reso- lution necessary for zone delineation.</p>

              assessed using synoptic meteorolog- ical tools and three locations with significant pop- ulation centres and different prevailing climate were
              identified. A case study building, based on the design proposed in a Government project that aims to built 759,523 houses across Kerala, was
              simulated under different conditions to understand the sensitivity of daylight and thermal performance to the climate in Kerala.</p>
