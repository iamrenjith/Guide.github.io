    <div class="row">
        <p >
        The Global South alone is expected to nearly double current global built floor space by 2050, driven primarily by growth in urbanisation. A typical building lasts 60 years and we spend about 90% of our lives in them. This means that buildings built now will have an impact on carbon, energy and health well into the 2080s.
        </p>

        <p >Hence, we need to design buildings in the Global South to be carbon, energy and health optimised from the get-go. But first there are significant challenges to overcome around equity, access, localisation, fitness-to-purpose, cultural sensitivity and cost. This conference will provoke thought and gather knowledge on how we can address these challenges at scale and with speed.

    <div class="row">
        <p >
        We want to encourage more research-active academics and research students from the Global South to take part in our conference. We're achieving this through:
        <ul>
          <li>reduced rates for participants from the Global South to enable the widest possible access.</li>
          <li>a fully virtual conference to eliminate travel, visa and accommodation costs as barriers to entry.</li>
          <li>a speaker line-up that reflects global diversity.</li>
        </ul>

      <p >
      Dr Sukumar Natarajan will moderate an Oxford-style debate where speakers will argue for and against the motion 'Building energy modellers are not literate.' Using audience polling, we'll measure audience sentiment before and after the debate to judge which side moved the most people and won the debate.
      </p>
      <h4>Speaking for the motion - Prof. David Coley, University of Bath </h4>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p> David started his academic career as a nuclear physicist, but a growing interest in tackling climate change led him to building physics. He is currently Professor of Zero Carbon Design in the Dept of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the University of Bath. His research interests span: the design of housing in refugee camps around the world, weather files for building simulation and simple energy/carbon models targeted at architects.

  <h2 align="left" style="color:red;">Research showcase</h2>
  <p >
    We plan to showcase key outputs from a series of high-profile research grants awarded under the Newton Fund between researchers in the UK and India. This will show what is achievable using effective collaboration between the Global North and the Global South.
