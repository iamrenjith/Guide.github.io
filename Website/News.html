          I’m a doctoral researcher at Loughborough University, United Kingdom. My research focuses on developing a
          building design guide that would assist during the early stages of design of residential buildings which would exhibit
          high thermal and daylight performance. The guide is developed, in the first instance, for Kerala –
          one of the 29 States India where no measures are specified in the building codes - Kerala Municipality/Panchayath Building Code -
          to ensure energy efficiency in residential buildings. My research covers:
          <ul>
            <li>Climate analysis to classify the climate zones of Kerala. A new method of classification,
              based on Adaptive Thermal Comfort Model, was developed as part of the research.</li>
            <li>Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis to understand the influence of different building design
              parameters on the thermal and daylight performance of buildings in the different Adaptive climate zones of Kerala.</li>
            <li>Dynamic thermal modelling and Climate-Based Daylight Modelling to understand the thermal and daylight performance of buildings.</li>
            <li>Web-developing/designing to present the building design guide.</li>
            <li>Usability testing to understand the acceptability of the developed guide among policymakers and practitioners.</li>
          </ul><!--As part of my research, I have developed a building design guide. This guide would help designers
          and architects in the early design stages for construction of buildings that would exhibit high thermal and daylight performance.

    <p><li><i><b>Climate-based building design:</b></i></li> Indoor comfort is greatly influenced by the outdoor weather conditions, and the
    responsiveness of buildings to the prevailing local climate plays an important role if the dual aspects of occupant comfort
    and low energy demand are to be met. My primary research interest is to aid the design and construction of buildings that would
    exhibit hight thermal and daylight performance and are tailored for the respective climate zones. With this view, I have developed a building
    performance simulation based design guide for construction of buildings in the different climate zones of Kerala (India). This guide would help
    designers and architects during the early design stages for construction of buildings that would exhibit high thermal and daylight performance.

    <p><li><i><b>Indoor Environment Quality in buildings:</b></i></li> The well being of occupants in a building is greatly influenced by the indoor environment
    quality. A number of factors such as thermal, visual, acoustic quality of indoor environment could greatly influes the comfort and well-being of occupants.
    I am interested in understanding and improving the indoor comfort conditions in buildings. In align with this intrest I had worked on understanding
    how the building design influences occupant thermal and visual comfort in different climatic condition. More information can be found

        <p> My paper on the “Influence of climate on performance of buildings in Kerala” had inferred that the State of Kerala has regions
         with different climatic characteristics and that the designs for buildings should be tailored for the climate zones of Kerala.
         These results are in contrast to the observation of the National Building Code of India and the American Society of Heating,
         Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.

         In 2018, Kerala witnessed the worst flood after 1924. In response, the Government
         of Kerala along with experts from the United Nation and the European Union assessed the the damages and losses and produced the Post
         Disaster Needs Assessment report. The results from paper were corroborated in the report.<!--, though not formerly cited! <span>&#128530;</span>.-->

             The paper summarises the results of the usability testing exercise of a new building performance
            simulation (BPS) based guide that offers assistance for designing high performance residential
            buildings. The guide, presented via a web-based platform aims to assist practitioners and
            policymakers during the early building design stage to achieve higher thermal and daylight
            performance. This study focused on (a) assessing the usability of the contents of the guide
            in assisting users during the early design-stages and (b) identifying design/navigation issues,
            for the web-platform, that would affect the user experience. The results of the usability
            testing showed that the participants generally perceived the design guide easy to use and
            valuable during early design stages. The participants found the concept of providing the guide
            via an interactive web-based platform useful, as it would be easily accessible to a wide range
            of audience. Furthermore, the participants provided suggestions on areas for possible future improvements.

            Influence of Building Design on Occupant Comfort in Adaptive Climate Zones.

            The responsiveness of buildings to prevailing local climate plays an important role if the dual aspects of occupant comfort and low
              energy demand are to be met. This study takes as example the State of Kerala in India where the Government – as part of the project titled “Livelihood
              Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) mission” – plans to build more than 750,000 houses across the State, using a uniform design, irrespective
              of the location or climate. A previous study has identified regions with different climatic characteristics within Kerala using a method based on
              adaptive thermal comfort model. This study aims to understand how the building design influences occupant comfort in the different adaptive climate
              zones by performing an uncertainty analysis on the output metrics. The thermal comfort was assessed based on the hours requiring heating/cooling while
              visual comfort was assessed based on the Useful Daylight Illuminance metric. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to identify design parameters
              that influence occupant comfort. The results of this study will serve as a reference for practitioners during the early stages of design to achieve
              thermal and visual comfort for high performance residential buildings.

            Classification of climate zones for building design and energy assessment purposes plays a vital role in aiding building engineers
              and architects in achieving energy efficiency in buildings using building performance simulation. Previous studies highlighted the need for climate
              assessments at higher resolutions for the purpose of climate classification but failed to infer the resolution requirement. In this study, climate
              zones of Kerala (one of the 29 States in India) are defined and delineated with climate data from grid resolutions of 10, 15, 20 and 25 km. The
              delineated zones are then assessed by comparing them with the thermal performance of a building representative of building typology of Kerala to
              identify the grid resolution necessary for zone delineation.

            between visual comfort, thermal comfort and energy performance is to be achieved. In this study, the climate diversity of Kerala (India) was
            assessed using synoptic meteorological tools and three locations with significant population centres and different prevailing climate were
            identified. A case study building, based on the design proposed in a Government project that aims to built 759,523 houses across Kerala, was
            simulated under different conditions to understand the sensitivity of daylight and thermal performance to the climate in Kerala.</p>
