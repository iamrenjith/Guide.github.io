														<p class="tm-mb-40">By Andy Tindale, Managing Director at DesignBuilder</p>
														<p class="tm-mb-40">November 15, 2021</p>
                            <p>
															One of the benefits of using building performance simulation in the design process is
															that it allows multiple variations on a base design to be assessed with little extra
															effort. This article explains how DesignBuilder's range of Parametric Analysis,
															Optimisation, Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis tools can be used at key stages of
															the design process as part of an evidence-based approach to design decision making.
															Each of these tools is intended to help answer certain types of question, and the
															article provides example applications for each to help you choose the right tool for the job.</p>

														<h3>Summary of Parametric Tools</h3>
														<p>First off a summary of the types of parametric study that can be carried out.</p>
														<p>
															Parametric Analysis is commonly used to generate design curves or histogram outputs
															to show how performance parameters like energy use, cost and comfort vary as key
															elements of the building design are adjusted. DesignBuilder can automatically run
															multiple simulations, adjusting up to 2 variables to create the design curve outputs.
															Design curves can be useful to help you understand how building performance is affected
															by variations in the building configuration and operation. For example, you can plot the
															variations in cooling demand for the base design with a range of window to wall ratios
															and glazing type variations. Or for future climate studies you can gain insights into
															building performance for a range of future climate scenarios (for more on this see the
															Examples Applications section below).</p>


														<figure>
                                <img src="img/DB/Trial/para2.png" alt="Image" class="mb-3 img-fluid">
                                <figcaption class="tm-color-primary">Figure 1 Typical parametric analysis design
																	curve showing relationship between building CO2 emissions and WWR and glazing type.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
														<br>
														<p>Optimisation is a systematic technique for efficiently identifying the set of design
															options that best meet the design performance objectives that you define. Design constraints
															can be applied if for example you are only interested in design variants within your project
															budget, or you want to focus on solutions with discomfort hours below a set level. The
															parametric simulation results are often displayed as a point cloud to illustrate the trade-off
															between the 2 main design objectives, with the Pareto optimal solutions on the “leading edge”
															of the point cloud as shown in Figure 2 below.
														</p>

														<figure>
                                <img src="img/DB/Trial/para3.png" alt="Image" class="mb-3 img-fluid">
                                <figcaption class="tm-color-primary">Figure 2 Optimisation results (left) and
																	post-processed results (right)</figcaption>
                            </figure>
														<br>
														<p>The graph on the left above shows the parametric point cloud for all simulations
															in a design optimisation study with the optimum “Pareto Front” results highlighted in red,
															illustrating the trade-off between cooling energy and construction cost for a range of
															configuration options. The right-hand graph is the same data post-processed with colours to
															illustrate clusters of results with different characteristics to help gain a deeper insight
															into the performance variations.</p>

														<p>Uncertainty Analysis. Building performance simulation is a complex process and many of the
															model inputs are often best available estimates and simplifications that do not necessarily
															represent the reality completely. These uncertainties can be due to lack of information,
															construction issues, occupant behaviour or even changes in weather. This can therefore limit
															our confidence in the outputs of the model. Uncertainty Analysis presents results as a "likely
															probabilistic range" rather than "deterministic fixed number”, helping to quantify the
															variability in the calculation results due to uncertainties in the model inputs.</p>

														<p>Sensitivity Analysis. While uncertainty analysis quantifies the variability of a model's
															outputs due to uncertainty in the inputs, Sensitivity Analysis is the study of how the
															uncertainty in each simulation output can be apportioned to the various sources of uncertainty
															in its inputs. Sensitivity analysis is often used to report on the design variables having the
															greatest/least impact on the key simulation results. This which can be a useful preliminary step
															to an optimisation analysis. Once the least important design variables have been identified they
															can be removed from the study to simplify the analysis and reduce simulation time. Sensitivity
															analysis can also be used to help manage risk in a systematic way as part of energy performance
															contract analysis, for example.

														<br>
														<h3>Example Applications</h3>

														<p>This section includes some typical example applications along with some less obvious examples
															to provide ideas about how you might incorporate parametric tools as part of your energy modelling workflow.</p>

														<h3>Design Optimisation at Early Design Stages</h3>

														<p>A common question at early design stages is "what are the most cost-effective facade configurations
															which minimise annual energy consumption while simultaneously ensuring occupant comfort". Because the
															façade affects so many aspects of the building operation (solar gain, daylight/glare, heat conduction,
															system sizes etc…) the answer is never simple! If there was a glazing type that reduces solar gain, has
															high daylight transmission, is low cost and has low embodied carbon then the question doesn't even arise!
															However this is rarely the case and some degree of trade-off will always be involved when specifying a façade design.</p>

														<p>DesignBuilder's design optimisation tools allow you to identify a set of optimal design solutions and
															navigate the trade-offs, helping you decide how to prioritise the design objectives. Understanding the
															trade-off between the various design options and their impact on environmental performance allows designers
															to navigate the often complex relationship between design objectives, constraints and design options, allowing
															informed recommendations to be made with greater confidence.</p>


															<figure>

	                                <figcaption class="tm-color-primary">Figure 4 Example design study shows the trade-off between building CO2
																		emissions and construction cost for the optimum solution set only (full point cloud not displayed).
																		The most “balanced”, cost-effective solutions are likely to be those closest to the origin, such as the
																		solutions coloured in red and green.</figcaption>
	                            </figure>
															<br>
														<h3>Tuning HVAC System Control Parameters</h3>

														<p> Optimisation tools can also be used later in the design process to help identify the optimum set of control
															parameters for building HVAC and other systems, for example. <a href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/#CustomEMSScriptExample.htm">DesignBuilder's Program Help</a> illustrates the
															possibilities through a simple worked example that explains the process of setting up and optimising a custom
															control rule to govern heating system optimum start times based the night-time outside air temperature.</p>

														<p>The optimum start algorithm uses DesignBuilder’s built-in EMS scripting tools to create a simple linear rule
															which calculates the heating system start time based on earliest and latest possible start times and their c
															orresponding outside temperatures. The example study asks the question “what is the best ‘earliest start time’
															to be applied in the algorithm” that minimises both occupant discomfort and building heating load? As you might
															expect, a trade-off is involved. The earlier the heating system can switch on, the less discomfort occupants are
															likely to feel on the coldest mornings of the year, but the more heating energy will be consumed over the year.
															The solution is to run an optimisation study with ‘earliest possible start time’ as a design variable and
															objectives to minimise both discomfort hours and heating energy. Because there is only one design variable,
															the point cloud forms along a curve and it’s simply a question of selecting a point on the curve that gives the
															best trade-off between early morning discomfort and heating energy.
														</p>

														<figure>
																<img src="img/DB/Trial/para6.png" alt="Image" class="mb-3 img-fluid">
																<figcaption class="tm-color-primary">Figure 5 shows how variations in the "earliest start time" algorithm
																	parameter affects heating load and discomfort.</figcaption>
														</figure>

													<p>Figure 5 shows that as the earliest allowed start time is reduced from 7am to 1am, the levels of discomfort
														decrease at the expense of higher heating energy. The results also show diminishing returns in terms of comfort
														when reducing the earliest start time much below 4am. A "balanced" option at around 5am was selected in this study.</p>

													<p>A similar process can be used to help select one or more optimal settings in within any EMS script, or within the
														built-in EnergyPlus HVAC control systems.</p>
													<br>

													<h3>Future Climate Studies</h3>

													<p>Building designers are increasingly being asked how their buildings will perform in future climate conditions. Of
														course it is far from clear how much warmer it will be, and how the solar incidence, wind and rainfall will be affected,
														especially as these factors will be influenced by policy decisions that are made now and in the future, as well as many
														other unknowns.</p>

													<p>To help building designers assess future building performance, organisations such as CIBSE and CSIRO have issued sets
														of ‘future weather years’ for building simulation that take into account the impact of various projected climate change
														scenarios. These are based on a series of standard assumptions related to economic and population growth and to the
														effectiveness of the solutions applied. Future weather files can be used instead of the usual historical weather data in
														building models to assess future building performance.
													</p>

													<figure>
															<img src="img/DB/Trial/para7.png" alt="Image" class="mb-3 img-fluid">
															<figcaption class="tm-color-primary">Figure 6 Impact of the range of CIBSE London future climate scenarios on predicted
																discomfort hours. The full range of CIBSE weather files can be ordered from the <a href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/software/cibse-weather-data-sets" >DesignBuilder website</a>.</figcaption>
													</figure>
													<br>
													<p>DesignBuilder offers a convenient way to assess the impact of future scenarios on building performance using its parametric
														analysis tools, which allow the weather data to be defined as a variable. KPIs such as discomfort hours, cooling energy or
														maximum load etc can be selected as the output or a new KPI can be created with a script.</p>

													<p>The process involved in setting up and running a future climate study such as that illustrated in Figure 6 is explained in
														a tutorial in the <a href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/#ParametricAnalysisTutorialFutureClimateStudy.htm" >DesignBuilder Program Help</a>.</p>

													<h3>Energy Performance Contract Analysis</h3>
													</p>

													<figure>
															<img src="img/DB/Trial/para8.png" alt="Image" class="mb-3 img-fluid">
													</figure>

													<p>Contractual performance targets are a powerful way of delivering building performance, however committing to such targets
														requires engineers to consider the risks and implications very carefully. A risk assessment can be carried out through a
														systematic uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to help to reduce the risk for all stakeholders.</p>

													<p>Sensitivity testing was traditionally done by changing selected variables one at a time, which can be useful in evaluating
														the relative comparison of design decisions, but it cannot determine the effect of combinations of variables changing at the
														same time. DesignBuilder allows a much more rigorous parametric approach by changing multiple variables simultaneously to test
														a wider range of combinations and provide a more robust sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.</p>

													<p>Parametric sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification methods can help you manage the risk by indicating the
														probability of meeting the target performance. The analysis ranks the inputs according to importance, thereby indicating the
														parameters that require safeguards to ensure the performance targets are met. In this systematic approach, statistical metrics
														are used to determine the likelihood of achieving or missing the performance targets, and regression methods identify the
														design variables with the greatest influence on performance.</p>

													<p>You can find out more about these techniques in our "Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis: Simplify and Speed up Optimisation
														Studies" webinar, listed below, which is based on a case study office building project in the UK subject to an energy
														performance contract. It shows how DesignBuilder’s UA/SA tools can help project teams create quantified risk assessment reports
														that allow them to measure and manage the risks associated with achieving performance targets for improved design and
														operational decision making.</p>

													<h3>Sensitivity Analysis as a Precursor to Optimisation</h3>

													<p>Complex optimisation studies with a large number of design variables can be slow to converge and any unnecessary complexity
														makes it difficult to find clearly distinguishable trends. Some variables might not have a significant influence on the
														outputs which can make the assessment of the relative importance of other more important variables difficult. Sensitivity
														Analysis (SA) can be used as a precursor to optimisation to remove less influential variables from the optimisation runs,
														reducing the complexity and overall optimisation runtime. Also, if the variable is influential for only one of the objectives,
														its value can be predetermined with SA and removed from the optimisation. With a focus only on the important variables, the
														optimisation results are cleaner, quicker and easily understandable.</p>

													<p>Another advantage of using SA, is that it helps you to understand any trends associated with design variables and makes it
														easier to see these in the results. For example, SA can tell us the relationship of each design variable with the design
														objectives and whether they are directly or inversely correlated, providing insights into whether an increase in the design
														variable leads you towards or away from your design objectives.</p>

													<p>You can read more about this technique on our <a href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/#SAUATipsTricks.htm" >Uncertainty And Sensitivity Analysis - Tips And Tricks help page</a>. The technique
														is also demonstrated in the "Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis: Simplify and Speed up Optimisation Studies" webinar listed
														below.</p>
